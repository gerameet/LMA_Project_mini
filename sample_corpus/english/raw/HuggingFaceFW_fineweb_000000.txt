sigh Fundamentalist community, let me pass on some advice to you I learned from the atheistic community: If you have set yourself on fire, do not run. Okay? Okay?? Please? Look, D, you had two months to say to Harvard in private emails, "Im sorry, I shouldnt have been using that animation in my paid presentations. I wont use it again. I really do like 'Inner Life', though, and would love to use it in classroom presentations, from the BioVisions site, if that is acceptable." I sat here, for two months, waiting for that to happen, anything to happen, and it didnt. Two months, on your own terms, you could have written a similar post to yesterdays. I would have given you the benefit of the doubt-- maybe you didnt know the credits werent visible to the audience, and I wouldnt have said a word beyond this, as its Harvards problem, not mine. This would have been a funny joke to those of us involved in dealing with you people, but it would have been a PR non-issue for you. But after you set yourself on fire, you didnt douse it out with a bucket of ice cold reality and accountability. You ran. And youre still running. Why not just state "I screwed up. Sorry everyone." and move on? Why the excuses? Why the denial? Why the passive language? Why the vague words and cryptic capitalizations? Why the writes and rewrites of your 'press release'? We know it wasnt written of your own volition, or it would have been done before Harvard had to take action. And, your behavior before this, regarding this issue, is not indicative of someone who made an innocent mistake. Its weird. So what with this frantic running? Is the inability to say "I was wrong" a pathological feature of Creationists? Or are you hiding something? Or is it both? Or is it more? And now we get Casey weighing in on the issue, according to cre8id at AboveTopSecret.com-- PBSNOVA online - Intelligent Design on trial: ...to my knowledge, Discovery Institute has neither authorized nor received nor is making use of any presentation that used that animation. We have had nothing to do with creating or selling a DVD of that animation, nor do we have anything to do with placing that presentation on Google Video.I dont know what he is talking about with that last part, but the first part sounds similar to DIs claims post-Dover ("WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DOVER!"). Maybe Luskin is telling the truth. Maybe this was a magic non-science Creation-friendly narration with convenient edits that AiG or ICR would have killed for... but only Dembski could find it... but he cant tell us where... and he didnt share it with anyone... and its subsequently disappeared from the Internet... But that simply isnt what Ive been told. Maybe this was all a silly Dembski mistake, blown out of proportion due to his decision to remain silent... But what if we find more videos of more DI fellows, presenting this animation? shrug If youve set yourself on fire, do not run, DI. If youve done it, better admit it to Harvard now, apologize, and move on.

Free the Cans! Working Together to Reduce Waste In a blog about how people share, its worth the occasional reference to the bizarre ways that people DONT SHARE. Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know its not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could share my question with the world: Why cant people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why cant the cans share driveway space? The Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions: - Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime. - Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesnt do this yet, tell them its a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland. - Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc. - Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take whats left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot. - Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones. - Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, youll have almost no trash each week. - Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage. - With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat. A much more pleasant alternative to the garbage can jailhouse ambiance, wouldnt you agree?

ORLANDO, Fla.  While the Rapid Recall Exchange, the 2-year-old industry recall portal, has signed up more than 600 manufacturer and retailer subscribers, it still lacks the critical mass of suppliers that would make it a primary source of recall information, according to trade association officials and retailers. Manufacturers use the exchange to communicate timely and accurate product recall and withdrawal notifications to retailer and wholesaler headquarters, which in turn share the information with individual stores. The exchange's retail membership represents 85% of U.S. grocery volume  including 21 of the 24 largest supermarket chains based in the United States  but it still lacks key suppliers, especially in the fresh food sectors, said Pat Walsh, senior vice president, industry relations, education and research for Food Marketing Institute, Arlington, Va. We have good penetration among manufacturers on the dry grocery side  though it needs to be better  and need to expand in other fresh food verticals like meat, produce, deli and bakery, said Walsh, who participated in a session on the RRE at the U Connect Live conference here earlier this month. Major food distributors in the exchange, including Kroger, Wegmans and Wakefern, have recently sent letters to their vendors explaining that the only way they will accept recall information is via the RRE, noted Brian Lynch, senior director of business and industry development for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington, who also participated in the U Connect Live session. In an April letter posted on www.rapidrecallexchange.org, Kroger asked all of its suppliers to subscribe to the exchange by July 1. Michael Roberson, director of corporate quality assurance for Publix Super Markets, Lakeland, Fla., said in the U Connect Live session that the chain is disappointed in the number of manufacturers using the Rapid Recall Exchange. Only 222 of our grocery suppliers are signed up, and more than 1,000 have not yet joined, Roberson said. We need to have the entire food industry collaborating on the Rapid Recall Exchange. Last year, of the 300 recalls Publix experienced, fewer than 50 went through the RRE, he said, adding that industrywide only 15% of recalls were submitted to the RRE. A total of 65 recalls have been issued through the exchange industrywide since its September 2009 launch. For recalls that went through the RRE at Publix, Roberson observed the absolute excellence in the information that was communicated, including product GTINs (global trade identification numbers), the reason for the recall, and photos. If we get this information from our trading partners using RRE, then we eliminate most of the internal steps because everything works together through this tool, he said. By contrast, for recalls that don't go through the RRE, nine times out of 10 we're going back to trading partners and seeking out additional information. Publix has been proactive in urging manufacturers to join the exchange, Roberson said. In addition, Publix has expanded its supplier scorecard to monitor and rank suppliers on whether they leverage the RRE. The RRE was created by FMI and GS1 US, Lawrenceville, N.J., which will be issuing a new version of the exchange, 2.3, in August.

September 28, 2010 2010 Season - Bowman pulls down CCIW honor Matt Bowman was named CCIW "Runner of the Week" after his fourth place finish at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational in Rock Island, Illinois on September 24. Augustana senior Matt Bowman (Geneva HS, Elburn, Ill.) was selected as the Runner of the Week in the College Conference of Illinois & Wisconsin. Bowmans strong performance helped the Vikings finish second at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois on Saturday, September 24. It was an impressive second place finish for head coach Paul Olsens crew as they beat four nationally ranked teams. Augustana, ranked sixth in the latest U.S. Track & FieldCross Country Coaches Association Division III Mideast Regional poll, was one of three teams ranked in the top 10 to compete at the meet. Wisconsin-Stevens Point, ranked fifth, took the team title with 23 points. Augustana finished second with 55 points while Wisconsin-Whitewater, the seventh ranked team in regional poll, placed third with 88 points. Olivet Nazarene took fourth (138), Truman State was fifth (150) and Greenville placed sixth (263). The field also included a couple of ranked teams in the Division III Central Regional poll. Cornell College, ranked ninth, finished tenth in the team scores with 307 points. Grinnell, the number one ranked team in the Central region, finished 16th with 415 points. Bowman led the way for Augustana with with a fourth place finish and a time of 25:10 over the 8,000 meter course. The Vikings had ten runners run a time of 26:01 or faster. Tim Thornburg of Wisconsin-Stevens Point won the individual race with a time of 24:58 while teammates Terry Witkowski and Joel Heroux finished second and third with times of 25:00 and 25:10, respectively. Earlier this year, Bowman finished second overall at the Western Illinois Invitational in a time of 26:11 leading the Vikings to a team victory over a field that included Western Illinois, a Division I school. The next week Bowman was the second Viking runner to cross the line at the Illinois Intercollegiate Championships. He finished in a time of 25:49, which was good for a 26th place finish in a field made up of the top college runners in the state of Illinois. Augustana, which has only lost to two NCAA Division III schools this year North Central at the Illinois Intercollegiate meet on September 17 and this past week to Wisconsin-Stevens Point at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational on September 24  will have a weekend off before they head to Waverly, Iowa to run at the Wartburg Invite on Saturday, October 9. Bowman, the son of Gary Bowman of Geneva, Illinois and Linda Bowman of Elburn, Illinois, is an art history major.

Kraft Foods has taken the Cadbury chocolate brand in a new direction, by combining it with cheese for the first time. The company is bringing together two of its brands and launching Philadelphia with Cadbury, a chilled chocolate spread made from Philadelphia Light and Cadbury chocolate. Kraft believes the new product has the potential to do very well and is targeting 10m in sales in the first year. The new cheese and chocolate spread is being launched on 1 February and will be appear in the chilled dairy aisle next to plain Philadelphia Light. It is launching in a 160g tub and a 120g four-pack of mini tubs, both with an rsp of 1.62. Kraft is supporting the launch with a 3.2m marketing budget in 2012 and is targeting 2,000 tonnes in volume sales  equivalent to about 10m  in the first year. If they reached this volume of sales, the new Philadelphia with Cadbury would have the same market value as Garlic & Herb, currently the biggest-selling flavour in the Philadelphia portfolio. Kraft already offers chocolate variants of Philadelphia in Italy and Germany, using Milka chocolate and targeting the breakfast occasion. In Germany, Philadelphia with Milka has generated 22.2m in sales since its October 2010 launch and has a 6.6% value share of the chocolate spread market. Kraft Foods UK marketing manager Bruce Newman said: The UK product would be positioned as a snack. The breakfast market in countries such as Germany is more developed, and our consumer research firmly identified Philadelphia with Cadbury as a snack.

The Net Neutrality repeal vote is coming. Tell these Dems to vote Yes. The House of Representatives is likely to vote tomorrow, Thursday, on the repeal of the FCCs Net Neutrality power grab. Using the Congressional Review Act, the repeal of the Net Neutrality order can be accomplished in an expedited way. In particular this means the bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate, so passing it means something. As Seton Motley said: This is our first opportunity  Read More
